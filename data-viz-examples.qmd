# Interative Dashboard

I created the below dashboard to go with paper ["The Route to Graduation"](https://doi.org/10.1177/15210251231156421) that explored the association between transit accessibility and Pell completion rates. The dashboard allows you explore different slices of the data used in the paper, e.g. different regions and/or college types. The dashboard was developed using Shiny and R.

If this isn't displaying right, you are using a smaller screen, or you just want to explore the dashboard in more detail, it might be easier to view it in its own window [here](https://ttalvlatt.shinyapps.io/rtg-dashboard/).
