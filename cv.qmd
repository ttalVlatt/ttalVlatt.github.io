    _*Co-Instructor*_ #h(1fr) _Spring 2024_ \
    - Took over instruction and grading for the technical R portions of the course following Dr. Skinner's departure
    - Refreshed the #link("https://capaldi.info/7916/")[course website] including simpliying some of the core content (e.g. loops), updating the .Rmd lesson to Quarto, and adding a Tidyverse to SQL translation lesson
    - 4.3 out of 5.0 course evaluation #link("https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/")[see public results]
    _*Teaching Assistant*_ #h(1fr) _Spring 2023_ \
    - Assisted Dr. Skinner with 1:1 troubleshooting for lessons and assignments during class and office hours
    - Designed and taught #link("https://edquant.github.io/edh7916/lessons/mapping_api.html")[a new lesson] on mapping and working with spatial data in R based off a real-world past GA task
    ]
    
  _*Research Experience*_ \
  - Created a time-series matrix of neighboring colleges to explore the impact of policy changes on transfer patterns
  - Spatially merged meteorological and government emergency response data with IPEDS to explore the impact of extreme weather on colleges
  - Spatially lined up TX community college service areas with high school districts to explore equity of institutional access
  - Gathered data and created tables and visualizations for a #link("https://partnershipfcc.org/publications/adequacy/")[report targeted at state policy makers]
  - Created a new dataset of state-run merit-based aid programs in the US which led to a #link("https://doi.org/10.1177/00915521241238753")[new typology being proposed]
