## Research Responsibilities

Work with Dr. Frank Fernandez on research relating to college access, primarily taking responsibility for data-related tasks (gathering, cleaning, analysis, and visualization).

*College Climate Vulnerability (Summer 2023 - Fall 2023)*

-   Spatially merged meteorological and government emergency response data with college institutional data to explore potential impacts of extreme weather on higher education institutions.
-   Built a Shiny app to gather image feedback where the most relevant images to the current selection would be automatically displayed below.

*Linking Community Colleges and High Schools in Texas (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)*

-   Created spatial boundaries for TX community college service areas from legislation and Census shapefiles to spatially match community colleges to feeder high schools.

*Exploring Equitable Higher Education Funding Models in Illinois (Summer 2022)*

-   Collected data on Illinois appropriations for higher education, labor market projections, census data, and institutional behavior, then drafted data visualizations using R (tables, graphs, and maps) for a report targeted at state policy makers.

*Merit-Based Financial Aid (Fall 2021 - Spring 2022)*

-   Created a new dataset of all state-run merit-based aid programs in the United States including details on dates active, award amount, merit criteria, and funding rules, leading to a new typology being proposed (see Hu et al., in press).
