Notes on development:

cv.qmd is possible due to

section bibliographies
https://github.com/pandoc-ext/section-bibliographies
to create a separate bibliography for each section of the cv (using quarto's inbuilt zotero functionality)

and

conditional formatting
https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html
to hide the citations, as nocite is universal for the document and doesn't work with the section bibs
