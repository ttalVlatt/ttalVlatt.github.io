Hi there, welcome to my website! This site is still evolving, but its general purpose is to show visitors a little more about me and the work I've done. With that said, who am I?

-   I'm Matt, aspiring education data scientist and Ph.D. student at the University of Florida 🐊.

-   I really enjoy designing and coding data visualizations 📈 📉 , [check out my Data Viz examples page](/data-viz-examples.qmd).

-   For my Ph.D. research, I'm currently exploring how transportation 🚌 🚏affects access and success in college 🎓. See my work on that [here](https://doi.org/10.1177/15210251231156421).

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:m.capaldi@ufl.edu)!
