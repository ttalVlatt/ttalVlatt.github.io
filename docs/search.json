The dashboard allows you explore different slices of the data used in the paper, e.g. different regions and/or college types. The dashboard was developed using Shiny and R.\nIf this isn’t displaying right, you are using a smaller screen, or you just want to explore the dashboard in more detail, it might be easier to view it in its own window here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Point Analysis\n\nHot-Spot AnalysisOutlier AnalysisLocal RegressionInterpolation\n\n\nHi\n\n\nHi again\n\n\nHelloooo\n\n\nHi\n\n\n\n\n\nGIFs for Data Viz"
